Quick demo I made using create-react-app and deployed on Netlify.

Project can be viewed on https://pricelinedemo.netlify.com/

My aim was to create a demo in line with Priceline's current practices and objectives.

- Accessibility
- Styled-Components
- Design-System ( Check out our open source repo https://github.com/pricelinelabs/design-system )
- React and Redux

I used Redux without a backend, instead temporarily storing cart data, which did not persist after a reload.
